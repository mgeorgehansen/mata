# mata: Modern c++17/OpenGL 3.3core Learning App

Mata is just my personal project to learn modern c++ and OpenGL 3.3 core. My goal is to produce a simple game developed using best practices for developing c++ applications, including using the c++17 standard, cross-platform Windows/linux/MacOS support, and CI/CD and comprehensive test coverage.

I come from the web programming world and have somewhat limited experience with systems programming, but c++ has always facinated me and I wanted to give it a proper try. I plan to publish my devlog and notes so that others can follow along with my experiments and learn from my experiences.
